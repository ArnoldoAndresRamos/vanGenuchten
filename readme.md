This is a python library to calculate hydraulic properties using van Genuchten's equations (Van Genuchten, M.T., 1980. A closed-form equation for predicting the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils. Soil science society of America journal 44, 892â€“898.). Specifically you can obtain parameter values for the default soils in that paper, have access to functions to solve the theta, C and K funcitons, and also plot these properties.
